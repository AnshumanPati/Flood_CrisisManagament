# EarthQuake_CrisisManagament
GUI Software consisting of earth quake prediction and disaster management
This project will consist of following parts:-  
i)  Earth Prediction using machine learning or AI based models.
ii) development  of appropriate disaster management strategy based on the collected data from disasters in the past

## Earthquake Prediction

Earth Quake:- Sudden  movement  of  the  earthâ€Ÿs  crust,  causing  destruction  due  to  violent  activities caused  due  to  volcanic  action  underneath  the  surface  of  the  earth. 

The dataset will be analyzed and fed into machine learning algorithms to predict the occurence of earth quake based on many factors like geographical location, time-frames of previous occurrences.

Salient feature:-
1. Predict  earthquake  based  on  time  series  data.
2. Predict magnitude of earthquake using RNN
3. Building a data  warehouse for  earthquakes occurences in the form of graphs for better decision making. This will also help in disaster Management module

Here we will be using Tensorflow based model to build Reccurent Nueral Network for prediction in a given time frame.
This model is also better because it also takes help of previous occurance timeline to predict for the future events making it fit even for after-shock prediction.

## Disaster Management System
In this we also will be implementing GUI framework to deal with Disaster  Management  Strategies:     

The aim of disaster management System will be:-
1. Minimize casualties
2. Rescue victims on time
3. Offer first aid instantly
4. Locate and Evacuate people to safe places
5. A temporal analysis of peoples need after the earthquake from blogs and social media using text mining and semantic analysis techinques.

Natural  disasters like earthquake claim numerous lives and cause significant damage to property. There have been many efforts to predict 
the disasters based on various sources of data. Social Media and Internet  have also been helpful important source  of information in prediction of the disasters and they have contributed significantly to early detection and adoption for effective disaster management.

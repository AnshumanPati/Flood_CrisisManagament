# EarthQuake_CrisisManagament
GUI Software consisting of earth quake prediction and disaster management
This project will consist of following parts:-  
i)  Earth Prediction using machine learning or AI based models.
ii) development  of appropriate disaster management strategy based on the collected data from disasters

## Earthquake Prediction
Earth Quake:- Sudden  movement  of  the  earthâ€Ÿs  crust,  causing  destruction  due  to  violent  activities caused  due  to  volcanic  action  underneath  the  surface  of  the  earth. 

The dataset will be analyzed and fed into machine learning algorithms to predict the occurence of earth quake based on many factors like geographical location, time-frames of previous occurrences.


Here we will be using Tensorflow based model to build Reccurent Nueral Network for prediction in a given time frame.
This model is also better because it also takes help of previous occurance timeline to predict for the future events making it fit even for after-shock prediction.  

## Disaster Management System
In this we also will be implementing GUI framework to deal with Disaster  Management  Strategies:     

The aim of disaster management System will be:-
list
Minimize casualties
Rescue victims on time
Offer first aid instantly
Locate and Evacuate people to safe places
